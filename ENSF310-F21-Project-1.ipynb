    "In this project, you will create a visual graphic of data from a dataset of your choosing.  The dataset may be of any topic, however, it must meet the following criteria:\r\n",
    "- Come from a trustworthy and verifiable public source.\r\n",
    "- Be properly cited in your project.\r\n",
    "- Contain at least two columns of data and consist of at least 500 rows.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "With this data, you need to create a visual that summarizes the data and presents some insight.  Simply plotting the data is not sufficient - you must manipulate the data to derive additional information (a running average, a trendline, annotations, etc).  The visual must be easy to understand.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Examples of datasets:\r\n",
    "- hourly CO2 data from Mauna Loa\r\n",
    "- hourly weather data showing seasonal and annual trends\r\n",
    "- electricity production and demand data for Alberta from AESO\r\n",
    "- national and/or local statistics for COVID-19\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The image below is an example of a potential graphic which shows atmospheric CO2 data since 1980 and then overlays Jan-June 2020 data over it to show the impact of the pandemic on global CO2 levels. \r\n",

    "## Requirements\r\n",
    "- You may use .py files, however, you should use an annotated Notebook to explain your workflow.\r\n",
    "- Your final submission must be uploaded to git.\r\n",
    "- Your final graphic should have at least two subplots / subfigures and have at least four different data series.  \r\n",
    "- Plots should be well labeled and clear.\r\n",
    "- You may use any online resource for inspiration, however, you must cite all sources used outside of the course notes and Think Python textbook."
